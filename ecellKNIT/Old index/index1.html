							<h3>E-Talks</h3>
							<span class="position"></span>
							<p>Entrepreneurship begins from the minds of the people. It grows and further embeds itself in the consciousness when discussions are built. These discussions get common man involved in a subject. Such an event will prosper the growth of entrepreneurship culture in KNIT.</p>
							<p id="mod1">Entrepreneurship Cell, KNIT Sultanpur takes up an initiative to call the speakers who will motivate students towards entrepreneurship. They can be our alumni, a company representative or any guest of honor. Conducting this event shall be an impetus to the already growing start up culture here.
In the recent past, KNIT has witnessed start ups growing but not prospering as they should. A proper guidance from the mentors, the already entrepreneurs and our alumni can be a catch to make these start ups a success. 
Thus E-Cell Community, KNIT Sultanpur will be conducting Interactive Sessions, Panel Discussions and Seminars to make people aware about entrepreneurship, to make them interested in the field and help them grow professionally. This would personally help ideal minds to take a step ahead towards entrepreneurship.

<div id="mod2"><p>“Nobody is bothered about its institution more than it’s alumni” – N.R. Narayan Murthy</p>
<p>Costal is an initiative by E-Cell to make world aware about the achievements of the alumni of KNIT. They are the only source through which we have come to know about our college and its history. Their achievements and their laurels must not go unnoticed and thus we present some news related to our achievers.
Connecting Students with Alumni of the institution is what makes E-Cell unique of all. This perhaps gives the young engineering entrepreneurs a platform to present their start up ideas. With a step towards a well connected KNIT society, E-Cell shall conceivably be able to make the environment more “StartUp Friendly”.

								<h3>Entrepreneurship at a Glance</h3>
	
							</div>
							<div class="reading">
														<p>A word which means differently to different people. At it’s core, entrepreneurship is a mindset. It is broader than just creation of a new business venture. It’s a way of thinking and acting, about imagining new ways to solve problems and creating valuable products and services.
An entrepreneur is someone who can take up an idea, use their skills, will and courage to take extreme risk to do whatever it takes to make it a viable product or service. Thus exploiting the opportunities they perceive whenever they present themselves on a platform.</p><p>
Entrepreneurs are innovators, designers of new ideas and business practices. Some of the major qualities that are essential for being successful entrepreneur are leadership, a strong willpower, management of works and team building skills. They direct human, financial and material resources through various means to create products and services that generate wealth. Hence differing greatly from regular businessmen who elevate the prices of a product but not their actual value. 
People engaged in entrepreneurship. They create opportunities and help them prosper not only for themselves and those associated with their venture but also for people whose lives are indirectly linked with their startup. They also help in creation of jobs. A job improves the overall condition of the employee and his family which eventually helps the company prosper.
Initially when a person starts a venture, there are several factors that may affect its success or failure. These factors may include funding, management of resources, a clear idea of how will it get profits, knowledge of markets and general economy. This certain study of market and marketing strategy can best evolute a start up in good terms.
Our goal at E-Cell is to enable these budding innovators and job creators by providing technical knowhow. An access to all the resources they need, a platform to showcase their ideas or ventures and to connect with the experienced alumni, investors and the startup community in general. A strong start up culture has developed in India, with many people starting their own ventures to make use of the vast opportunities this diverse country presents to us. India is all set to rise again, and entrepreneurs, with their insurmountable willpower, creative ideas and effective execution will play a big part towards its ascent.

								<h3>Startup Updates</h3>
	
							</div>
							<div class="reading">
														<p>In the world where ideas drive the economy ,it's no wonder that innovation and entrepreneurship are often seem to inseperable fellows. Entrepreneurship is  turning an
 
idea into a business by means of technology . It's truth as said by many entrepreneurs that it is a stong desire to take risks , responsibility.</p><p id="blog1">The startup vocabulary mainly consists of resilience,survival, strategy, profitability. As in india , this year funds get dried up , a number of promising startup 

shuttered while others laid off employees. Flipkart , Snapdeal and Ola the poster children of indian startup scene, watched their valuation dropping , 

whereas Amazon and Uber with their strategic and detroited business model put their valuation appreciated .  Apple too put their stake in indian startup TUPLEJUMP

which is startup based on artificial intelligence and involves machine learning  that helps companies to store , process and visualise big data. Oyo rooms which is 

a service based startup for premium accomodation raised the fund of $100 million from Japan's company Softbank.


So, overall we can summarize that successful entrepreneurs are not driven by money ,they are driven by achievements. Sure, making money can be nice , but 

biggest reason why they are successful is because they are pursuing a higher purpose than themselves. They want to make a difference although money is good but 

changing the world is better. Entrepreneurship requires committment and dedication to their ideas , vision and businesses in order to make goal happen.
