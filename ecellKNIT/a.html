							<h3>E-Talks</h3>
							<span class="position"></span>
							<p>Entrepreneurship begins from the minds of the people. It grows and further embeds itself in the consciousness when discussions are built. These discussions get common man involved in a subject. Such an event will prosper the growth of entrepreneurship culture in KNIT.</p>
							<p id="mod1">Entrepreneurship Cell, KNIT Sultanpur takes up an initiative to call the speakers who will motivate students towards entrepreneurship. They can be our alumni, a company representative or any guest of honor. Conducting this event shall be an impetus to the already growing start up culture here.
In the recent past, KNIT has witnessed start ups growing but not prospering as they should. A proper guidance from the mentors, the already entrepreneurs and our alumni can be a catch to make these start ups a success. 
Thus E-Cell Community, KNIT Sultanpur will be conducting Interactive Sessions, Panel Discussions and Seminars to make people aware about entrepreneurship, to make them interested in the field and help them grow professionally. This would personally help ideal minds to take a step ahead towards entrepreneurship.

							<p>What is life when we don’t have elders to guide us? Isn’t it worthless?
Someone has rightly said,”If you don’t have elders, you don’t have guidance”. Thus to have guidance we connect here.

<div id="mod2"><p>“Nobody is bothered about its institution more than it’s alumni” – N.R. Narayan Murthy</p>
<p>Costal is an initiative by E-Cell to make world aware about the achievements of the alumni of KNIT. They are the only source through which we have come to know about our college and its history. Their achievements and their laurels must not go unnoticed and thus we present some news related to our achievers.
Connecting Students with Alumni of the institution is what makes E-Cell unique of all. This perhaps gives the young engineering entrepreneurs a platform to present their start up ideas. With a step towards a well connected KNIT society, E-Cell shall conceivably be able to make the environment more “StartUp Friendly”.
